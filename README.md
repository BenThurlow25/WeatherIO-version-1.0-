# WeatherIO-version-1.0-
My first time developing a full-stack application, created using JSX with a node.js back end and REACT for the front end.  I will be working to continually improve as I learn new things, this was very much a learning project for me so any tips or critique is appreciated! 

APIS and Attributions:
Geolocation data: Nominatim API
UVIndex Data: EPA API
Weather Data: NWS API
For timezoning and zipcodes: LocationIQ
Background of the UI is from 'reactbits.dev'

Features include: 
Timezone Aware UV index metric
Daily Forecast
Weekly Forecast
geo-tz for dynamic timezone resolution
Modular ES imports/exports for clean backend architecture
Reusable utilities like getLocalHour to match EPA hourly UV data to local time
Responsive React components with global styles for polished UI


Upcoming Features:
Fuzzytext recognition for cities (Very spelling sensitive right now)
Storm Mapping
Air Quality Display
Alerts and possible account system to save locations locally
